# OptiBot

OptiBot is a Python-based application designed for optimizing chatbot interactions. This application utilizes Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

#### Poetry Installation

We recommend using Poetry for dependency management and project setup. If you prefer to install Poetry using pipx, follow the [pipx installation guide](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/).

#### Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OptiBot.git
   cd OptiBot
   ```

2. **Initialize the Project with Poetry**

   If you haven't already, install Poetry:

   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```

   Then, set up the project using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

   This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file and installs all necessary dependencies.

### Running the Application

To run the OptiBot application, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This command launches the Streamlit web interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use the application, detailing any steps the user needs to follow to perform tasks or configure settings.
